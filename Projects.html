<p  style="text-align:justify;">
<font color='black' size=5px>
The School Management System is a dynamic and comprehensive application developed using the .NET framework and C#.
  Designed specifically for schools, it integrates multiple modules, including Students, Teachers, Subjects, Attendance, Enrolments, and Dashboard, 
  all seamlessly connected to a robust Microsoft SQL Server database. Administrators can log in securely using a username and password to manage 
  the entire system through intuitive,<b> CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) </b>operations. This centralized approach enables efficient handling 
  of key school-related data while ensuring high security and real-time updates.
<br>
  <br>
Each module in the system is tailored to simplify administrative tasks. The <b>Student Module</b> allows administrators to manage essential student details such as Name, 
  ID, Gender, Phone Number, and Email, while the <b>Teacher Module</b> handles similar functionalities for staff. The <b>Subjects Module </b>ensures streamlined course management,
  allowing the addition, deletion, and updating of course details. Other modules, such as <b>Enrolment and Attendance</b>, facilitate new student admissions and 
  attendance tracking. A Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of vital metrics, including the total count of students, teachers, and courses, 
  ensuring quick and easy access to important data.
<br><br>
With its user-friendly interface and strong database integration, this Windows Form-based School Management System offers a reliable solution for school operations.
  By consolidating diverse functionalities into one system, it reduces manual workload, eliminates redundancies, and ensures accuracy in managing school information.
  This project is ideal for maintaining and organizing student, teacher, and course data efficiently, while fostering better administrative oversight in educational
  institutions.

 </h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <font color='black' size=5px>
  <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Cs9UXd-i8lnzl3Oahq2U1RAYI5YrunGU">Project Link</a>
<br>
This project focuses on building a Machine Learning Model to predict whether a person is affected by COVID-19 based on their symptoms. Developed using Python's 
  sklearn library and other essential tools such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the model leverages the COVID-19 dataset from Kaggle. The dataset undergoes 
  feature engineering and feature transformation before being split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. The prediction process takes an array of health 
  issues as input and outputs whether the individual is COVID-positive or negative. Various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier,
  Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosting were trained and evaluated, achieving respective accuracies of 94%, 97.13%, 97.57%, and 97.33%.
<br>
  <br>
The project demonstrates the comparative performance of different algorithms, with Random Forest Classifier delivering the highest accuracy of 97.57%. 
  The model identifies patterns in symptoms to make accurate predictions, showcasing the utility of machine learning in addressing critical healthcare challenges. 
  By analyzing input symptoms, the model reduces dependency on extensive diagnostic testing and provides quick preliminary results. This predictive capability
  is particularly useful in triaging patients and prioritizing testing in resource-constrained environments, making it a valuable tool for healthcare resource
  management during the pandemic.
<br><br>
Overall, this project exemplifies how data-driven approaches can contribute to solving public health challenges. Beyond accurate COVID-19 prediction,
  it also offers insights into the relative importance of various symptoms in the disease's progression. Such a model not only aids medical professionals in
  understanding symptom significance but also underscores the potential of machine learning in enhancing large-scale screening and early detection efforts,
  ultimately helping to contain the spread of the virus in a cost-effective manner

<p style="text-align:justify;">  <font color='black' size=5px>
  <a href="https://github.com/AnjaliPuram05/Temperatute_Converter">Project Link</a>
<br>

The Temperature Converter web application is a user-friendly tool designed to perform accurate temperature conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. 
  It features an intuitive interface with a central input field for entering numerical values, a dropdown menu for selecting the input unit, and a prominent 
  Convert button to trigger the conversion. The results are displayed in a visually distinct output area styled for clarity and readability. 
  The layout is thoughtfully designed with logical element positioning and professional styling, including classic fonts and soft colors, ensuring an 
  excellent user experience.
<br>
  <br>
Powered by a JavaScript function, convertTemperature, the application handles input validation and performs precise calculations based on the selected unit.
  Depending on the userâ€™s selection, the function applies conversion formulas to calculate the equivalent temperatures in the other units and displays the
  results dynamically in the output area. The results are rounded to two decimal places and clearly labeled with units, ensuring accuracy and readability.
  With its robust functionality and elegant design, the application offers a seamless and efficient solution for temperature conversions.</font></p>
