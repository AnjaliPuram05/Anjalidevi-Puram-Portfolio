Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Robot Intelligent Fixture planning 
This project presents a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework
  for optimizing fixture placement in robotic manufacturing. Agents collaborate to minimize surface deformation 
  using Nash-Q learning and Finite Element Analysis (FEA). A Gaussian-based reward function guides policy updates based on deformation outcomes. 
  The approach is validated on bus and fan components, demonstrating improved structural stability.

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning Model to predict whether a person is affected by COVID-19 based on their symptoms. Developed using Python's 
  sklearn library and other essential tools such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the model leverages the COVID-19 dataset from Kaggle. The dataset undergoes 
  feature engineering and feature transformation before being split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. The prediction process takes an array of health 
  issues as input and outputs whether the individual is COVID-positive or negative. Various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier,
  Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosting were trained and evaluated, achieving respective accuracies of 94%, 97.13%, 97.57%, and 97.33%.
<br>
  <br>
The project demonstrates the comparative performance of different algorithms, with Random Forest Classifier delivering the highest accuracy of 97.57%. 
  The model identifies patterns in symptoms to make accurate predictions, showcasing the utility of machine learning in addressing critical healthcare challenges. 
  By analyzing input symptoms, the model reduces dependency on extensive diagnostic testing and provides quick preliminary results. This predictive capability
  is particularly useful in triaging patients and prioritizing testing in resource-constrained environments, making it a valuable tool for healthcare resource
  management during the pandemic.
<br><br>
Overall, this project exemplifies how data-driven approaches can contribute to solving public health challenges. Beyond accurate COVID-19 prediction,
  it also offers insights into the relative importance of various symptoms in the disease's progression. Such a model not only aids medical professionals in
  understanding symptom significance but also underscores the potential of machine learning in enhancing large-scale screening and early detection efforts,
  ultimately helping to contain the spread of the virus in a cost-effective manner

<br>

The Temperature Converter web application is a user-friendly tool designed to perform accurate temperature conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. 
  It features an intuitive interface with a central input field for entering numerical values, a dropdown menu for selecting the input unit, and a prominent 
  Convert button to trigger the conversion. The results are displayed in a visually distinct output area styled for clarity and readability. 
  The layout is thoughtfully designed with logical element positioning and professional styling, including classic fonts and soft colors, ensuring an 
  excellent user experience.
<br>
  <br>
Powered by a JavaScript function, convertTemperature, the application handles input validation and performs precise calculations based on the selected unit.
  Depending on the userâ€™s selection, the function applies conversion formulas to calculate the equivalent temperatures in the other units and displays the
  results dynamically in the output area. The results are rounded to two decimal places and clearly labeled with units, ensuring accuracy and readability.
  With its robust functionality and elegant design, the application offers a seamless and efficient solution for temperature conversions.</font></p>
