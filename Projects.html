The School Management System is a dynamic and comprehensive application developed using the .NET framework and C#.
  Designed specifically for schools, it integrates multiple modules, including Students, Teachers, Subjects, Attendance, Enrolments, and Dashboard, 
  all seamlessly connected to a robust Microsoft SQL Server database. Administrators can log in securely using a username and password to manage 
  the entire system through intuitive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This centralized approach enables efficient handling 
  of key school-related data while ensuring high security and real-time updates.
<br>
Each module in the system is tailored to simplify administrative tasks. The Student Module allows administrators to manage essential student details such as Name, 
  ID, Gender, Phone Number, and Email, while the Teacher Module handles similar functionalities for staff. The Subjects Module ensures streamlined course management,
  allowing the addition, deletion, and updating of course details. Other modules, such as Enrolment and Attendance, facilitate new student admissions and 
  attendance tracking. A Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of vital metrics, including the total count of students, teachers, and courses, 
  ensuring quick and easy access to important data.
<br>
With its user-friendly interface and strong database integration, this Windows Form-based School Management System offers a reliable solution for school operations.
  By consolidating diverse functionalities into one system, it reduces manual workload, eliminates redundancies, and ensures accuracy in managing school information.
  This project is ideal for maintaining and organizing student, teacher, and course data efficiently, while fostering better administrative oversight in educational
  institutions.
